    "Float and Decimal data types are both used to store numerical values. Float is Approximate-number data type, which means that not all values in the data type range can be represented exactly , it rounds up the values, where as Decimal is Fixed-Precision data type, which means that all the values in the data type range can be represented exactly with precision and scale, it doesn’t round up the values. Performance of decimal is slower as comapared to floating point data type. Float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type. Floating point data type represent number values with fractional parts. Decimal accurately represent any number within the precision of the decimal format, whereas Float cannot accurately represent all numbers. Decimal used within financial applications that require a high degree of accuracy and easy to avoid rounding errors whereas Float used when you stores scientific numbers and for better performance."

Fractions, on the other hand, express one integer divided by another integer, and often equal a decimal number. Because of this, not all fractions can be turned into integers by merely completing the division. When a fraction appears as part of an equation, however, we can multiply the whole equation by the inverse of the fraction or a multiple of the inverse to turn the fraction into an integer. Invert the fraction we wish to eliminate. The inverse of a fraction is the fraction flipped upside down. For example, in the equation 1/2x + 5 = 9, the inverse of 1/2 is 2/1 or 2. So , here inheritance comes intop picture as the fraction consists of one integer divided by another integer."
