    "\n",
    "The “No Free Lunch” Theorem argues that, without having substantive information about the modeling problem, there is no single model that will always do better than any other model. Because of this, a strong case can be made to try a wide variety of techniques, then determine which is the model to focus on. In other words, the “no free lunch” (NFL) theorem for supervised machine learning is a theorem that essentially implies that no single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems."

    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods usually produces more accurate solutions than a single model would. This has been the case in a number of machine learning competitions, where the winning solutions used ensemble methods.\n",

    "In machine leaerning, Ensemble method plays a significant part.To outline the definition and practicality of Ensemble methods, Decision Trees plays an importnat role. A Decision Tree determines the predictive value based on series of questions and conditions. Decision Trees can also solve quantitative problems as well with the same format. When making Decision Tress, there are several factors which come into picture. Rather than just depending upon one Decision Tree and hoping we made the right decision at each split, Ensemble Methods allow us to take a sample of Decision Trees into account, calculate which features to use or questions to ask at each split, and make a final predictor based on the aggregated results of the sampled Decision Trees."
