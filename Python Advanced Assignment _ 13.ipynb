    "In Python, positive and negative indexing are possible in case of list, string. Positive indexing starts from 0 and negative indexing starts from -1. 0 refers to the first element of the datatype and -1 refers to the last element of that datatype. And we can see both positive and negative indexing from the above programme and that has been performed on a string. The repercussion is that the positive indexing will print the elements of a datatype from left to right and negative indexing will do that from right to left. So, positive indexing is opposite to negative indexing."

    "Python is a very flexible language where a single task can be accomplished in several ways. Likewise there are several ways to initialise a list with 1000 elements.

Now let us have a look at the average time taken by each of these above mentioned methods through the following programme to intialise a list of 1000 elements over 500 times."

    "From the above programme , we can say that the average time taken to initialize the list of 1000 elements is almost the same in case of for loop and while loop having a little difference. List comprehension performs better as compared to while and for loop. But * operator method is faster than any other method over here. But the problem with * operator is that it is not applicable to declaring a 2D array or list . That would create a shallow list means only one list object would be createdand all the indices would refer to that list object. That might result in unwanted coimplications. Also it should be noted that the times will vary based on the platform where this code is executed. These times are just for studying the relative performance of these methods of initializing."
