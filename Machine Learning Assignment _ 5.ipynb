    "Range would be difficult to extrapolate. The interquartile range is similar to the range but less sensitive to outliers . The interquartile range is calculated in almost the same way as the range. First of all we need to find the median value or middle value of the lower and upper half of the data. The values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). Now we need to subtract first quartile from the third quartile. And that is IQR ( The Interquartile Range). The equation of IQR is :\n",

    "Box plots (also called box-and-whisker plots or box-whisker plots) give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. They also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. A box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a box plot, we use a horizontal or vertical number line and a rectangular box. The smallest and largest data values label the endpoints of the axis. The first quartile marks one end of the box and the third quartile marks the other end of the box. Approximately the middle 50 percent of the data fall inside the box. The “whiskers” extend from the ends of the box to the smallest and largest data values. The median or second quartile can be between the first and third quartiles, or it can be one, or the other, or both. The box plot gives a good, quick picture of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a situation called negatively skewed then the lower whisker surpasses the upper whisker in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dataset of values, any value which is more than the upper limit or less than the lower limit will be conssidered as outliers. And with this principle, a box plot can be used to identify outliers.  Only the data that lies within Lower and upper limit are statistically considered normal and thus can be used for further observation or study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example.\n",
    "Suppose there are n number of values present in a dataset.The median (Q2) is the middile or mid value of that dadaset. \n",
    "Mathematically, Q2 = (n + 1)/2 th term\n",

    "Q1 = (n + 1)/4 th term\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper Quartile is Q3 which is the median of upper half of the dataset.\n",
    "Q3 = 3*(n + 1)/4 th term\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Interquartile range (IQR) is (Q3 - Q1). Lower Limit = Q1 – 1.5 IQR. Upper Limit = Q3 + 1.5 IQR\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11 here n = 11, Q2 or median = (11 + 1) /2 = 6 th term and that is 6, Q1 or lower quartile =(11 + 1)/4 = 3 rd term = 3, Q3 or upper quartile = 3 *(11 + 1)/4 = 9 th term = 9 Now IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 9 - 3 = 6\n",
    "Lower Limit = Q1 - 1.5IQR = 3 - 1.5 *6 = 3 - 9 = -6 and Upper Limit = Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 9 + 1.5 *6= 9 + 9 = 18\n",
    "Hence it is clear that any range above 18 or below -6 are outliers. But such values do not exist in the given dataset.But, if any such values exist in the dataset then those values could have been outliers.\n"
