A class is more of a unit and a module is a loose collection of stuffs like variables , functions or even classes.

    "\n",
    "In Python operators work for built-in classes. For example : the '+' operator will perform arithmetic addition operation on two numbers, concatenate two strings, merge two lists. This Python feature that allows  the same operator to perform different operations in accordance with the context is named operator overloading. Let us consider thwo objects which are physical represntation of a class and those two objects are user-defined data type. Now if we are going to add up those two objects with binary '+' opeartor then it throws back an error, because the compiler does not know how to add up two objects. In that scenario, operator overloading comes into pictures to accomplish this task. The below example is to perform addition operation of two complex numbers by using binary '+' opeartor overloading."
