Model-based system learn by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predicitons on new data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make a prediction, a new instance's features are fed into a hypothesis function which uses the minimized theta found by repeatedly running the cost function."

The machine learning models are highly efficient in providing accurate results, but it takes a tremendous amount of time. Slow programs, data overload, and excessive requirements usually take a lot of time to provide accurate results."

To build the test set we split the training data (50-50, 60-40, 80-20 are common splits) into a training set and test set. Our model is training with the training set. Then we use the model to run predictions on the test set. Our error rate on the test set is called the generalization error or out-of-sample error.
