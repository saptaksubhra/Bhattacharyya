    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. For example, in an experiment of tossing a coin twice the sample space is :{HH, HT, TH, TT}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are given below to predict the values of a random value.\n",
    "Step 1: List all simple events in sample space. Step 2: Find probability for each simple event. Step 3: List possible values for random variable X and identify the value for each simple event. Step 4: Find all simple events for which X = k, for each possible value k. One example is given below.\n",

    "75% of Americans support universal healthcare. So, the probability that randomly selected group of 3 peoplewill all be in favour of universal healthcare. Here the given percentage is 75% . Changing the percentage to a decimal it will be 0.75. In the next step we need to multiply  the decimal found in first step by itself. We need to repaet as many times as we are asked to choose an item. For example, if we need to puick up 3 items at random then we should multiply 0.75 by 3 times = 0.75x0.75x0.75 = 0.4218 (rounded off to 4 decimal places). That is how to find the probability of a random event."

    "The distinction between true random number generators (TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated or generated by software).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are generated by computer software which runs on regular hardware. and is highly deterministic. That means it runs the same everytime. It is really difficult to generate a real random number in software as it runs also predictably to be considered random.That is why the properly implemented pseudo-random numbers are good enough for most of the applications."

    "A fair rolling of dice is also a good real-life example of normal distribution. In an experiment, it has been found that when a dice is rolled 100 times, chances to get ‘1’ are 15-18% and if we roll the dice 1000 times, the chances to get ‘1’ is, again, the same, which averages to 16.7% (1/6). If we roll two dices simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36). More the number of dices more elaborate will be the normal distribution graph."
