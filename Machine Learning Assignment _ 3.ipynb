    "2.Describe the process of human learning:\n",
    "i. Under the supervision of experts : Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent. And just because you are intelligent, it does not mean you should have a good memory. However, there are exceptions to these rules. Humans begin learning by memorizing. After few years, he realizes that mere capability to memorize is not intelligence. Then he practices on transforming the data stored in memory to knowledge and applies them to develop skills to solve problems faced in real life. A person with good memory and more knowledge without the required skills cannot be considered intelligent. Search engines replaces human memory and these days the focus is on acquiring intelligence by making use of data available on the web. In humans, learning speed depends on individuals and in machines, learning speed depends on the algorithm selected and the volume of examples exposed to it.\n",

    "4.Examine the various forms of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly, there are four types of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Supervised Learning : This machine learning is based on supervision. In this machine learning technique, we train the machine using the labelled dataset and on the basis of the training the machine predicts the result. Briefly , first and foremeost we train the machine with input and corresponding output and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Unsupervised Learning : Unsupervised learning technique is different from supervised and supervision is not involved in unsupervised learning. In unsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts the output without any supervision. In unsupervised learning, the models are trained with the data that is neither classified nor labelled, and the model acts on that data without any supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning : This machine learning algorithm lies in between Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning. It represents the intermediate ground between Supervised (With Labelled training data) and Unsupervised learning (with no labelled training data) algorithms and uses the combination of labelled and unlabeled datasets during the training period. Although Semi-supervised learning is the middle ground between supervised and unsupervised learning and operates on the data that consists of a few labels, it mostly consists of unlabeled data. As labels are costly, but for corporate purposes, they may have few labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement Learning : Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based process, in which an AI agent (A software component) automatically explore its surrounding by hitting & trail, taking action, learning from experiences, and improving its performance. Agent gets rewarded for each good action and get punished for each bad action; hence the goal of reinforcement learning agent is to maximize the rewards. In reinforcement learning, there is no labelled data like supervised learning, and agents learn from their experiences only.\n"

For example, regression methods can take historical pricing data, and then predict the price of a similar property to retail demand forecasting.\n",

    "Classification : Classification algorithms can explain or predict a class value. Classification is an essential component for many Artificial Intelligence applications, but it is especially useful for eCommerce applications. For example, classification algorithms can help predict if a customer will purchase a product, or not. The two classes in this case are “yes” and “no”. Classification algorithms are not limited to two classes and can be used to classify items into a large number of categories. Such as male or female, spam or not spam."

    "\n",
    "i. Regression: In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables. For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Classification: It involves grouping the data into classes.  For example, if we are thinking of extending credit to a person, we can use classification to determine whether a person would be a loan defaulter or not. \n",

    "iii. Naive Bayesian Model : The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph. The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. And each child node is assumed to be independent and separate from the parent. \n",
    "One example is Decision Trees : A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their probable consequences. The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. A decision tree can be used to solve problems with discrete attributes as well as boolean functions. Some of the notable decision tree algorithms are ID3 and CART.\n",

    "iv. Random Forest Model: The random forest model is an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputs a classification of the individual trees.

A random forest model would accomplish the task, given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test for graduate programmes. \n",
