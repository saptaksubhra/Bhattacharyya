    "The usual rule for matching in Regular Expressions is sometimes called “left-most longest“ and that is called Perl(Beacuse the Perl pattern matching is greedy.) which is greedy matching. It means that the parser tries to match as much as possible. And when it is \"left most shortetst or minimal match that is called non-greedy matching. So , the basic difference between  greedy and non-greedy is that the greedy match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible and the non-greedy match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. Greedy quantifiers or syntaxes are *, ?, +, {a}, {a,b}. And the non-greedy quantifiers are the combinations of these greedy quantifiers. Such as: '??', '*?', '+?', {a,b}?\n",
    "\n",
    "The bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy pattern is by using '?' at the end of Regular Expression i.e '*?' matches the smallest number of instances of the preceding subexpression that will allow the overall match to succeed. Similarly, '+?' matches at least one instance, but no more than necessary to allow the overall match to succeed, and '??' matches either zero or one instances, with a preference for zero.These are the cahracters we can introduce.\n",

    "The benefit of referring to groups by name is that it makes the code more readable and more organised rather than by numberin a stnadard expression. For example, if an user enters his or her birthday then he or she will have to enter according to day, month , year. Using the group() function in Python, without named groups, the first match (the month) would be referenced using the statement, group(1). The second match (the day) would be referenced using the statement, group(2). The third match (the year) would be referenced using the statment, group(3). By default, groups, without names, are referenced according to numerical order starting with 1. Let's say we have a regular expression that has 3 subexpressions. Now, with named groups, we can name each match in the regular expression. So instead of referencing matches of the regular expression with numbers (group(1), group(2), or group(3)), we can reference matches with names, such as group('month'), group('day'), group('year'). By seeing, group(1) we really do not know what it represents.But, if we see group(month) then we can say it refers to month. The example has been given below."

    "When parsing a string the scanner interface is perfromed by re.search() method.  This method either returns None(In case there is no match in pattern) or re.matchobject that contains information about the matching part of the string. This method stops after the first match, so this is the best method suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data. On the other hand, re.findall() method returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in a string as a list of strings.The string is scanned from left to right the matches are returned in the same order as it is found. Two examples have been given below interms of both methods."
