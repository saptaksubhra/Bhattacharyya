    "\n",
    "The raising of class-based exceptions changes the programme flow. They can either be handled directly or propagated upwards along the call hierarchy. In this way, not every procedure or method has to consider every possible exception situation itself. This supports the separation of concerns within an application. Because the exception can be represented by an object of an exception class, this exception object can gather additional information about the exception situation and transport it to the handler. And that is why class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers."

The __context__ attribute is for Implicit Exception Chaining method, the __cause__ atrribute is for Explicit Exception Chaining method and the __traceback__ attribute is for traceback method. A new raise ... from statement sets the __cause__ attribute.\n",

If this happens, then  exception B is propagated outward and exception A is lost. In order to debug the problem, it is useful to know about both exceptions. The __context__ attribute retains this information automatically.\n",
