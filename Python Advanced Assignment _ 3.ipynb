    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Superclass is a common superclass for several subclasses. It factors up common behavior and defines the methods they all respond to. Methods that subclasses should implement are declared abstract. The abc module defines ABCMeta class which is a metaclass for defining abstract base class. Following example defines Shape class as an abstract base class using ABCMeta. The shape class has area() method decorated by abstractmethod. "
