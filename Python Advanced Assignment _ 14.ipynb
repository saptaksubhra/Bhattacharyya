    "It is very simple to create a function as well as a generator function. The one improvement that must be made in order to make a normal function avaialable as a generator function is by adding a yield statement to a normal function instead of return function. If a function contains at least ione yield statement then that function becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function. But the main differenec is that while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls."

    "Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "Generators allow us to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They allow programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way. One of the advantages of the generator over the iterator is that elements are generated dynamically. Since the next item is generated only after the first is consumed, it is more memory efficient as compared to the iterator."
