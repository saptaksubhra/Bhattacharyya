This test data is equivalent to the future unseen data points.\n",

K should not be taken as even number it should be odd i.e:- 1,3,5,7,9. In KNN algorithm, finding the value of k is not easy. A small value of k means that noise will have a higher influence on the result and a large value make it computationally expensive. \n",
