    "1.Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.\n",
    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses; that means with propositions whose truth or falsity is unknown. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under frequentist inference, a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability."
