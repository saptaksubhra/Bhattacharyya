    "Quick R-CNN is a single-stage model that is trained end-to-end. It uses a novel region proposal network (RPN) for generating region proposals, which save time compared to traditional algorithms like Selective Search. It uses the ROI Pooling layer to extract a fixed-length feature vector from each region proposal."

    "\n",
    "A Region Proposal Network or area proposal network, or RPN, is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals.\n",
    "RPN and algorithms like Fast R-CNN can be merged into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with attention mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look.\n",
    "RPNs are designed to efficiently predict region proposals with a wide range of scales and aspect ratios. RPNs use anchor boxes that serve as references at multiple scales and aspect ratios. The scheme can be thought of as a pyramid of regression references, which avoids enumerating images or filters of multiple scales or aspect ratios."

This layer is used because the fully-connected layer always expects the same input size, but input regions to the FC layer may have different sizes.\n",
